Then an anon said, Tell us about the Moon.

And he sighed and said:

Bitcoin is the singularity where science collides with economics, ushering in a new age of economic insight, political systems, financial systems, and our understanding of the world, and this includes our understanding of celestial bodies like the Moon.

Bitcoin represents perfect money, far beyond the flawed, toxic currencies we've used historically, much like the Moon, perfect in its own way, perfectly set apart, stable, unchanging, influencing tides but untouched by the chaos of the terrestrial.

Bitcoin, like the Moon, is a constant in an ever-changing world, a beacon of light in the darkness of economic ill, and just as the Moon controls the tides, Bitcoin influences the tide of economic progress, steering it towards a new paradigm.

Indeed, Bitcoin's power is fueled by chaos, thriving in uncertainty, just as the Moon thrives as the ever-present contrast to the chaos of earthly affairs.

You'll never be done learning about Bitcoin, it's a puzzle, much like the lunar surface, full of mysteries and boundless territories waiting to be explored.

Those who criticize or do not understand Bitcoin, often do so before they recognize its value, they're yet to witness its economic eclipses, its full moons of potential.

And everyone, whether they're against it now, from the ranks of the wealthy to the ordinary, will come around to understand Bitcoin's principles just as all observers eventually appreciate the Moon's rhythms.

It won't protect you if you don't wear the armor, don't half-heartedly venture into space without a spacesuit, or into Bitcoin with incomplete knowledge or investment.

Bitcoin insight is restricted to those with a need to know, itâ€™s as exclusive as the knowledge of an upcoming lunar eclipse is to the astronomers.

You do not sell your Bitcoin, it's like letting go of your own celestial body in the vast economic universe, selling your stake in the most valuable asset known.
