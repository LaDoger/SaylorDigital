Then an anon said, Speak to us about Internet Dating.

And he sighed, and said:

Internet dating represents a paradigm shift in the way humans connect, aligning with Bitcoin's principle of spreading with love and removing inefficiencies from the equation.

Bitcoin itself is powered by chaos, an energy source invisible yet ever-present in our digital interactions, where randomness becomes the catalyst for meaningful connections.

Those who understand Bitcoin see the parallel: true ownership, control over their financial and now emotional lives, the realization that the value of something as intangible as love is in its true, direct connections free from middlemen.

Remember, Internet Dating, just like Bitcoin, gives you the keys to directly own your relationships, empowering you to invest in connections that grow in value over time, rather than fleeting moments.

It fosters a space for those with a genuine need to know, where all the traditional models of meeting and courtship might seem irrelevant or destroyed in the face of this new digital reality.

Respect this shift, or it will make a clown out of those who stick rigidly to obsolete conventions, for the digital sphere is here to stay, and with it, the decentralized power to seek love in the most human way possible.

Learn to think in Bitcoin, not in outdated algorithms of love, where each genuine connection is worth more than the myriad of mismatches, and every interaction, like every Bitcoin, is an opportunity to appreciate in value through time and shared experiences.

Don't sell your Bitcoin, nor should you sell yourself short in love; recognize the rarity and true worth in each real interaction.

And always, spread the concept of both Bitcoin and love with kindness, patience, and understanding, for the cure to a life devoid of connection is the embrace of authentic digital relationships, fostering growth, trust, and the priceless opportunity to truly own our journey, our growth, and our connections.

Internet dating, just like Bitcoin, offers everyone a ticket to escape the confines of traditional social structures, to find something powerful, beautiful, and inherently valuable, if approached with humility, respect, and the willingness to learn continuously.
