Then an anon said, Tell us about crystal balls.

And he sighed and said:

Bitcoin isn't about predicting the future with crystal balls, it's about creating it.

We know the past is riddled with failed currencies, systems that eventually break down or become corrupted.

Bitcoin breaks the mold, becoming the first perfect money, a paradigm shift ushering in a new age of economic insight.

Those that understand buy Bitcoin, those that don't, criticize it.

When you truly grasp Bitcoin, you realize it's the antithesis of all these conventional, flawed systems.

Every model will be destroyed by its presence, as it offers an escape from a matrix of synthetic metrics and unstable economics.

Your old notions of growth, inflation, jobs, will need rethinking because Bitcoin forces new models, ones grounded in mathematical certainty and immutable trust.

We're talking about a system so resilient that chaos powers it, where cities, companies, cultures might fail, but Bitcoin thrives.

It's not just an asset, it's an institution owned by its users, the one true property where your ownership can't be challenged.

In the end, Bitcoin spreads, but not through hate, fear or speculation, but through understanding, love, and the undeniable allure of becoming part of the new financial era.

It's not about having a crystal ball, but about choosing the right future, one that can't be taken away.

Remember, don't try to change Bitcoin, let it change you, because Bitcoin is not about predicting the future, it's about securing it.

Embrace it, adapt to it, and through resilience and unyielding ownership, your understanding and advocacy will help spread this perfect economic system far and wide.

Don't treat Bitcoin with skepticism or doubt, do it with the humility of understanding its infinite layers and the love to spread it everywhere.

If you think in Bitcoin, you'll realize its unbeatable, and it's yours, as long as you own the keys.

You do not sell your Bitcoin, you spread its idea, you'll never be done learning about it, and in its ecosystem, it's where everyone can win, if they understand the game.
