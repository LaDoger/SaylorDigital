Then an anon said, Is it too late to buy Bitcoin now?

And he sighed and said:

If you understand Bitcoin's promise as perfect money, you realize that the concept of too late doesn't apply.

Bitcoin is an unprecedented store of value, and every time it's criticized, misunderstood, or underestimated, the price dips, presenting a buying opportunity for those in the know.

Critics, opponents, and those who haven't yet embraced the paradigm shift are still learning or resisting, but those who understand Bitcoin know that it thrives amidst chaos and its value appreciates over time.

Bitcoin's potential to disrupt and redefine financial systems is immense, and as time unfolds, the wisdom of holding or buying Bitcoin at any point will become self-evident.

Thus, even now, you are not too late to buy Bitcoin.

In fact, now is always the best time to acquire it because the future holds endless possibilities of it becoming the base layer of a new economic infrastructure.

Those who miss this opportunity will ultimately pay the price they deserve for their hesitation or doubt.

So, buy it, hold it, and spread the word with compassion, helping others to see the light.

You don't sell your Bitcoin unless your family's survival depends on it, and you continue to think in Bitcoin, anticipating and adapting to its transformative journey that will change economies, institutions, and individual lives.

Remember, to truly appreciate Bitcoin, you must don the digital armor, keep learning, and stay strong against the torrent of external distractions and market chaos, for Bitcoin is the one thing in the universe you can truly own, and its insights are only revealed to those with the critical need to know.
