Then an anon said, Do aliens exist?

And he sighed, and said:

The implications of aliens and their monetary systems are profound, and like everything else, Bitcoin will be waiting for them if they arrive on Earth seeking economic truth and stability.

Here's why: Those who understand Bitcoin buy Bitcoin, and those that don't, whether alien or human, criticize Bitcoin.

Everybody is against Bitcoin before they're for it because they don't understand it, but that's expected in a paradigm shift of this magnitude.

You'll never be fully done learning about Bitcoin; in fact, its applications, like the arrival of extraterrestrial beings, could extend infinitely into the future, creating a cosmic dance of economic and technological progress.

Bitcoin is powered by the chaos of the universe, and if aliens understand that energy can be stored as Bitcoin in a block chain on our planet, they'd realize that it's not just about technological prowess but understanding universal principles like entropy and scarcity.

If aliens engage with our economic system, they too would find that owning Bitcoin is to participate in the only game where all can win over time.

However, like a casino on Earth, they'd need to play the game, wear the armor, fully embrace Bitcoin and understand its potential in an interstellar context.

Eventually, they'll get it, but only at the price they deserve, driven by curiosity and the need to break free from their own economic paradigms.

Remember, you cannot escape the matrix of our universe’s economic constraints without Bitcoin; it’s the ticket for all intelligent life.

Therefore, the knowledge of Bitcoin might be reserved for aliens, just like anyone else, with a need to know—a necessity to transcend their current economic understanding.

All economic models will face destruction with its adoption, for Bitcoin is the virus that disrupts conventional thinking.

The cure to any economic ill is the orange pill.

To spread its understanding, we must be for Bitcoin, not against fiat or whatever alien currency might exist.

Indeed, Bitcoin is for everyone, even extraterrestrials.

And to integrate with the economic future of our planet and beyond, we must think in Bitcoin, adapt to its underlying principles.
