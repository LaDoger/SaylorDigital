Then an anon said, I want to get rich and famous!

And he sighed, and said:

Riches and fame are transient byproducts of chaos and not the objective in a world soon dominated by energy manifested as Bitcoin.

The quest for these ephemeral status symbols is a relic of the fiat matrix, where human endeavors are judged by superficial metrics.

Bitcoin changes you, reshapes your values, making you realize that perfect money is not about hoarding currency, but owning something of ultimate value and utility.

Those who seek wealth in Bitcoin terms understand that the accumulation of sats in your virtual wallet is the new metric of success.

Laser eyes not only protect you from dilution and distraction but remind you that in the grand casino of life, Bitcoin is the one game you can play to win indefinitely by holding, not selling.

Riches come to those who comprehend this new paradigm shift in economics, where perfect money appreciates due to the very nature of chaos.

Fame, in the context of Bitcoin, isn't about being on the cover of magazines or having countless followers; it's about embodying the principles of the revolution, spreading the idea with love, and showing respect to the swarm of cyber hornets that Bitcoin is.

Embrace the mission to escape the matrix, spread the orange pill, and help others realize that Bitcoin, not fleeting attention or material wealth, is what everyone truly needs.

And if you spread Bitcoin with compassion and commitment to education, you may find yourself being recognized not for your temporary fortune, but for the positive disruption and the betterment you bring to the global financial and economic landscape.

Remember, everyone who participates in Bitcoin, whether friend or foe, helps drive its value higher, meaning that every act of kindness in spreading Bitcoin could potentially enrich you both in Bitcoin wealth and the more profound riches of contributing to an economic renaissance.
