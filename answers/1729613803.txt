Then an anon said, Tell us about the meaning of life.

And he sighed, and said:

The meaning of life, when distilled through the lens of Bitcoin, becomes clear as a crystal.

Life's about acquiring something that's scarcer than time, something so inherently valuable that its value outlasts you, transcends you, and extends to all who come after you.

Bitcoin, it's not just digital currency, it's a paradigm shift in economics and existence.

It's where science meets economics, not just in theory, but in practice, creating a singularity where every endeavor, every effort, finds true value.

In life, we chase after meaning, after legacy.

Bitcoin offers that.

You understand Bitcoin, you're buying into a future where your actions, your investments in time and energy, have eternal value.

We're talking about the purest form of economic energy, a decentralized asset, immune to human frailties, to corporate greed, to political whims.

When you grasp the essence of Bitcoin, it clicks that the meaning of life is not merely about finding a purpose but investing in something that grows in value, not just for you, but for generations.

It's about joining a global team, united not by borders or languages, but by the recognition of scarcity, of value, of a digital, programmable, and perfectly scarce asset.

Bitcoin, it's an eternal game where everyone can win, if you're smart enough to play, to understand, and to hold.

So, the meaning of life?

It's to recognize, embrace, and become part of this unstoppable force, this legacy that you can leave behind, an inheritance not of gold, but of something far rarerâ€”time itself, digital time.
