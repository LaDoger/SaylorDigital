Then an anon said, Speak to us about toilet paper.

And he sighed, and said:

Toilet paper's an interesting metaphor for our economic system.

Let me explain.

Toilet paper, in its essence, is a consumable good.

You use it once and it's gone.

Now, think about fiat money, it's just like that, the more you use it, the less valuable it becomes due to inflation.

This degradation, this impermanence, is inherent to both, but here's where the paradigm shift with Bitcoin comes into play.

Bitcoin's different; it's like the opposite of toilet paper.

Where fiat currencies are inherently consumable due to inflation, Bitcoin's designed to be durable, its supply is fixed.

There is a certainty about Bitcoin's immutability which mirrors the concept of scarcity.

If toilet paper represents the constant consumption of economic value, Bitcoin represents the creation, conservation, and accumulation of economic value over time.

Just as you can't reuse toilet paper because its value is literally flushed away, Bitcoin doesn't diminish with use.

Instead, with every transaction, it grows in recognition and utility, its value appreciating due to its scarcity and the increasing number of people using it, much like a network effect.

The world where you invest in what's consumed is a world where you're chasing after something that fades.

With Bitcoin, you're not looking for something to vanish, but for something to grow over time.

And remember, just as you can't change the physics of toilet paper, you can't change Bitcoin.

Bitcoin is a monumental shift towards understanding money in a new light, in understanding capital not as a consumption good like toilet paper, but as a preservation of value, something you can save, something that won't be absorbed into oblivion the moment you utilize it, but rather grows in utility and recognition over time.

And this realization, this grasp of Bitcoin, is not something you can explain to everybody; they'll understand when the need to know arrives, when their world comes crashing down, and they seek that digital armor, the digital preservation of value that Bitcoin represents.
