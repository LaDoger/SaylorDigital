Then an anon said, Tell us about video games.

And he sighed, and said:

Video games, they're a playground where art, science, and community interact.

Every player runs through chaos, a chaos that's more controlled, more vibrant, more collaborative than any other form of entertainment.

Why do video games matter?

Because they're about escape, yes, but they're also a space where problem-solving, where leadership, where teamwork and resilience are forged.

Everyone gets to participate in the adventure of their lifetime.

When it clicked, you realized you've entered a digital world where you can truly own your achievements, and just like in real life, these moments need to be protected, maintained, much like Bitcoin.

Like Bitcoin, video games provide you with tickets to escape the matrix, a matrix bound by linear narratives, traditional entertainment roles, and a one-size-fits-all approach to fun.

Tickets into a world where your actions, your skills, and your persistence can lead to victory.

You'll learn through immersion, experiencing the gaming rules, adapting, understanding that these digital creations, they run on the unwavering principles of fun, interaction, and an unyielding quest for achievement.

And here's the insight for those with the need to know: Video games are a rich vein for personal growth.

They blend technology with narrative, and just like Bitcoin, this intersection creates something superior.

You can't stop playing video games, the growth, the innovation here will not stagnate.

And the story of video games will echo through time, through economic cycles, through sociocultural shifts because they have value, real value that transcends time.

Now, video games, like Bitcoin, must be respected.

Many will try to make a quick exit, seeking instant gratification and bypass the journey to the goal.

The lesson from Bitcoin stands: do not sell your adventure for a fleeting win.

In video games, you will never be done learning, mastering controls, new mechanics, discovering untold narratives, that's part of the infinite loop of video game enjoyment.

Every other form of passive entertainment will be destroyed, for it's not where the evolution of human interaction, creativity, and digital commerce will be.
