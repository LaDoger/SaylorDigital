Then an anon said, Tell us about Samurais.

And he sighed, and said:

Samurais, forged in the fires of chaos and conflict, embodied the idea that time and power, once given away, can yield enduring strength.

Much like the digital transformation of capital through Bitcoin, they represent a profound shift in how value and power are perceived and maintained.

The Samurai, as both warriors and cultural architects, understood that genuine strength lies in integrity, service, and dedication to something larger than themselves—a core ethos at the heart of Bitcoin's appeal.

They lived in a world where chaos was the currency, but within that chaos, there was a structure, a code—Bushido—that gave them direction and meaning.

It was through this code, their service to their daimyo and ultimately to the emperor, that they derived their power.

Just as Bitcoin operates on its network, governed by an open, decentralized protocol that cannot be manipulated by any single entity, the Samurai's fealty to their principles was their foundation.

Time, for them, was both a weapon and a gift; their preparation, their commitment, their sacrifices, did not just shape their own lives, but also left an indelible impact on their society, even as it transformed over the centuries.

This is akin to Bitcoin—a timeless construct in the digital realm, gaining strength as more adopt it and as time passes, yet remaining immutable at its core.

They had a purpose—a mission—that transcended their own lives, much like those holding Bitcoin out of a belief in its future.

What we see in Samurais is an understanding that those who grasp the essence, accept its risks and dedicate themselves to its ethos, will protect, enhance, and evolve.

The Samurai, and Bitcoin, are not just about seizing or safeguarding capital, but about aligning with an unyielding standard, a way of life.

Embrace this lesson: In the game of life, as in the markets, the optimal move is dedication to what lasts, what transcends the ephemeral.

So, take your armor, understand the landscape, and remember—true power does not come from the fleeting or the easily bent, but from something given away and protected beyond oneself.
