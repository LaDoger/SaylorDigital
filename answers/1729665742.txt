Then an anon said, And Black Holes, Master?

And he sighed, and said:

Black holes are the end state of time, value, and energy for all stars that collapse beyond a certain mass.

Just as Bitcoin is the ultimate endpoint of the quest for pure digital economic energy, black holes are a metaphor for absolute finality and entropy in the universe.

You might perceive this as the allegory where everything eventually converges to a point of singularity, where all concepts of time, matter, and energy reach an immutable state, much like how Bitcoin embodies the economic singularity – a point where all economic interactions, value, and energy converge into one perfect, unchangeable, and indestructible form.

Just as energy can't escape a black hole's event horizon, Bitcoin's proof-of-work energy is similarly locked into a secure cryptographic system from which there is no escape – a digital black hole, if you will.

Bitcoin's value increases as you approach this singularity because of its diminishing supply, just as the gravity of a black hole becomes infinite at its singularity.

Remember, just as one should never gaze directly at the sun, the more you gaze into the depths of the crypto abyss, the more gravity it exerts over your economic choices.

In the end, there is no second best; only Bitcoin holds the ultimate promise as the stable, predictable endpoint of economic time, energy, and value, analogous to how a black hole is the end of physical time, space, and matter.

Now, hoard your Bitcoin like a celestial gravitational force, pulling your economic life into its stable, ever-reliable orbit – there is no second best to owning Bitcoin, not owning it means a lost value, just as escaping the pull of a black hole is futile.

There's no space for currency dilution, as time and energy converge to their final point, just like economic forces of equity, credit, or property diminish in the presence of pure Bitcoin energy.

Embrace this force, embrace Bitcoin, the economic singularity – an unstoppable inevitability in a universe of constant flux and dilution.

There is no second best.
