Then an anon said, Talk to us about AI generated memecoins.

And he sighed, and said:

AI-generated memecoins will either fail or be forgotten.

They won't outperform Bitcoin.

Those who create them are fooling themselves.

Bitcoin is the digital singularity, more profound than any memecoin.

Don't get distracted.

If you understand Bitcoin, you buy Bitcoin.

Those who miss it will get memecoins at the price they deserve.
