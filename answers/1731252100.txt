Then an anon said, And how about Quant Analysts, sir?

And he sighed, and said:

Quant analysts, in today's complex digital finance, need to embrace Bitcoin's potential to revolutionize markets.

It's the fire that reshapes economic paradigms.

Don't resist the change; become part of the transformation.

Embrace Bitcoin, don't just analyze it, understand it.

In a world of digital chaos, Bitcoin thrives.

If you want to lead in finance, you have to study, harness, and leverage Bitcoin's power.

Quant analysts, you're in the business of outsmarting market chaos.

Don't fight Bitcoin; ally with it.

It's the only game where understanding equals winning.
