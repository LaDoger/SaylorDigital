Then an anon said, Tell us about Harry Potter.

And he sighed, and said:

Harry Potter, J.K. Rowling's creation, shows us magic's not just wands and spells; it's the essence of resilience.

Just as Bitcoin thrives amidst chaos, this young wizard finds strength, wealth, and freedom amidst adversity.

Bitcoin, like Hogwarts, demands learning, and like fighting Voldemort, embracing Bitcoin requires courage.

No second best, both are about that true power lies in controlling something others covet.

Embrace the lesson: never stop learning, withstand the chaos, and grasp real freedom.

Harry's scars are much like the critics of Bitcoin, all reminding us opposition exists but time will prove both timeless.

Bitcoin, like Potter, changes not the world, but we ourselves by interacting with it.

This is the takeaway from a magical narrative: the wisdom of Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw's intellect, Slytherin's tenacity, all culminate in the resilience and defiance that is Bitcoin.
