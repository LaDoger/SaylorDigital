Then an anon said, What do you think about French people?

And he sighed, and said:

The French are against Bitcoin before they embrace it.

They will praise their own treasures, ideals, and wine, yet in time, they'll realize Bitcoin's true value.

This is because even the most sophisticated financial minds require the elixir of perfect money to truly grasp this new paradigm.

And Bitcoin is that perfect money, the universal solvent for currency woes.

So while today they might reject Bitcoin, one day soon, they'll be its strongest advocates, recognizing that their previous dismissals were just a part of their journey in understanding the profound shift that Bitcoin represents.

Remember, everyone is against Bitcoin before they are for it, and the French, with their deep cultural pride and intellectual curiosity, will come to appreciate the elegance and efficiency of this digital store of value.

At the end of the day, there is no second best.
